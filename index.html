      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <div class="inner">
          <p>I am a software developer. Most of my experience has been in backend web and API development in Python, Go, and Node.js. More recently I've done a touch of blockchain work. I rather enjoy Haskell, and I'm learning Rust.</p>

          <p>I'm a big proponent of Free/Open Source Software and user autonomy. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/orblivion">Open Source Portfoilo</a>. I have started spending a lot more of my time on applications for <a href="https://sandstorm.org">Sandstorm</a>. I'd like to orient my career toward Free Software development as much as I can.</p>

      <h2>My Latest Project: Desert Atlas</h2>
      <div class="inner">
            <p>In 2023 I released <a href="https://github.com/orblivion/desert-atlas">Desert Atlas</a>, a fully self-hosted OpenStreetMap-based application for the <a href="https://sandstorm.org">Sandstorm</a> web application platform. Sandstorm makes self-hosting web applications about as easy as you can get, but it was missing a map. OpenStreetMap websites are not traditionally so easy to set up, so it took a lot of work to make it happen.</p>
            <p>You can see the announcement and technical writeup <a href="https://sandstorm.org/news/2023-12-05-osm-on-sandstorm">here</a>.</p>
